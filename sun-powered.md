## Why Me?

18 months w/ solar panels

practical knowledge

computery guy by training and trade


## Why people choose Solar?

reduce dependency on non-renewables

reduce utility bills

insulate against future energy costs

increase home resale value

cool factor


## Solar PV 101

### 0. Sunlight


> the sun delivers more energy to Earth in one hour than humanity consumes over the course of a year  
> -- [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/414792/solar-power-will-make-a-difference-eventually/)


### 1. Solar PV Modules


> Photovoltaics is the direct conversion of light into electricity at the atomic level.  
> -- [NASA](http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2002/solarcells/)


remember solar calculators?

ever notice that old ones get flaky? 


> Photons strike and ionize semiconductor material on the solar panel, causing outer electrons to break free of their atomic bonds.  
> -- [Solar Energy Industries Association](http://www.seia.org/policy/solar-technology/photovoltaic-solar-electric)


solar panel output degrade over time

most manufacturers warrant ~80% of rated power after 25 years


### 2. Inverter


converts direct current (DC) into alternating current (AC)

(apologies to Nikola Tesla)


### 2a. Production Meter


measures what the system produces


### 3. Fusebox


backfeeding

bus bars don't care about the source of power


### 4. Battery (Optional)


expensive

heavy

maintenance


### 5. Meter


by default, meters measure absolute usage

net metering


### 6. Grid



## Acquisition


### Purchase

you own it

all the incentives

cash up front / special loans


### Lease / PPA

vendor-owned

buy power per-kWh

typically zero down

no incentives

Note: PPA are typically for 20 years.


### Community Solar

shared rooftops & spaces

shared costs

shared incentives

co-op style


## Picking a vendor

shop around

savings calculations (kWh)

3rd party contractors

reputation

local presence



## Paperwork

Note: Installer will take care of permits and should shepherd you through the paperwork and process.


### Inspection

roof: dimensions, orientation, gotchas

attic: truss spacing

electrical: panel


### System Design

CAD drawing

power output report: accounts for dimensions, orientation, roof pitch, shade, time of year


### Interconnect

notifies utility of intent to generate power

proper billing

safety for utility workers


### Incentives 

federal / state / local

grants

tax credits

[www.dsireusa.org](http://www.dsireusa.org/)

Note: Database of State Incentives of Renewables & Efficiency


### HOA Approvals

solar easements and rights laws

(tedious)


### SREC Registration

Solar Renewable Energy Credit

1 MW = 1 credit

commodity market

typically sold via aggregator to utilities

Note: Legislation mandates many utilities to provide energy from renewable sources. When they can't, they can be fined, so they buy credits from producers of renewable energy.

for a County inspector to check structure & electrical

for the power company to install the net meter

## Impact


### Daily

with net metering, usage unchanged

most days production > usage

w/o net metering, migrate demanding tasks to daytime


Energy Produced on 2 May 2016

![Monitor: realtime](assets/misc/monitor-day.png)


### Monthly

production varies by season

no maintenance required


Energy Products in 2015

![Monitor: realtime](assets/misc/monitor-annual.png)


### Long Term

12 months in...

85% of my electrical needs

50% expenses recouped

payoff expected in 5-6 years



## Monitoring


Dashboard

![Monitor: realtime](assets/misc/monitor-realtime.png)



## Gamification

inevitable, given data

measure everything

minimize usage


## Daily Usage


### Big Uses

2 kWh - fridge

2 kWh - always-only Internet**

<small>** fiber ONT, router, UPS, two wireless routers, Chromecast, VOiP bridge, VOiP handsets, core switch</small>

Note: 25&cent; per day for always-on Internet


### Lighting

largely overlooked

inefficient incandescent

3-way bulb > entertainment center

Note: Massive campaigns and rebate programs to urge consumers to migrate to CFL and LED.


### Electronics

most modern electronics are wildly efficient

1 kWh - 8 hrs WFH: laptop, monitor, speakers

&frac14; kWh - stream a movie on home theater

Note: That's 3&cent; to stream a movie.


## Standby Consumption

Note: Phantom power is a thing, but not for all devices. For example, USB chargers don't consume anything until you plug in a device.


### inkjet printer

1.4W standby

0.1W powered off

Note: This is the behavior you'd expect.


### Dell flat-panel 

35-45W in operation

3.7W standby

3.6W powered off

Note: For a basement server with an infrequently-used monitor... unplug it.


## Downsizing


### Home Server

Dell PowerEdge SC 440

100W = 72 kWh/month = $9.36

Raspberry Pi B+

1.6W = 1.5 kWh/month = 20&cent;

Note: Box was hosting media to be streamed to mobile, largely unused. Also home Asterisk instance.



## (Energy) Production Data

REST API

web scraping

[Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) to automate browser activity


### Enphase

> The [Enlighten API](https://developer.enphase.com/docs) allows mobile apps, building management tools and other software applications to access and use system performance data.  
-- [Enphase Support](https://enphase.com/en-us/support/what-api-access-and-what-it-used)


### SolarCity

> The PowerGuide API is a RESTful service that can be invoked from any HTTP client, and allows you to query PowerGuide Data.  
-- [PowerGuide API documentation](https://api.solarcity.com/powerguide/)


### SunPower

> The API was developed for our flex applications and there are no plans to make it available to 3rd party developers.
